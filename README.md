# FALLHACK

FALLHACK is a retro web-simulation of a stylized ARPANET/MILNET, circa 1984, a transcontinental network operated by the US Military.

It is a full multi-user simulation, including simulated hosts. The simulation takes inspiration from "Fallout", "TeleHack" , "Hacknet" and other terminal-focused games. 

The main focus of the project is to educate about internet and terminal history and technology.

# Fallout inspiration 
- UOS = U/DOS (Central Disk Operating System)
- The Enclave = The SysCorp Syndicate (SCS) 
- IBM = International Data Machines Corp. (IDM)
- Vault-Tec = Corporate Security Corp. (COP-SEC / CSC)
- RobCo = Robot & Computer Industries (RobCom Ind. / RCI)
- General Atomics + Poseidon Energy = General Energy Company Corp. (GEC)
- PoseidoNET = DEFCOM-NET, GEC-NET, NEURAL-NET, SYSCORP-NET
- West-Tek = Defense & Communications Industries (DEF-COM / DFC)
- Repconn =  Space HeliX Industries (SpaceH Ind.) 
- The Calculator = AI
- The Institute = Corporate Automation Institute (CAI)
